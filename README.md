## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm really rusty on css so this was a good refresh on how flexbox.

### Continued development

I would get familiar with flexbox, grid and how to manage the text since i wasn't able to make the title text look exactly like the challenge asked for.
